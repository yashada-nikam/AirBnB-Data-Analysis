# AirBnB-Data-Analysis



This project focuses on analyzing Airbnb data for the city of Seattle. The dataset includes information about various aspects of Airbnb listings, such as property details, pricing, availability, host information, and guest reviews. The goal of this analysis is to gain insights into the trends, patterns, and factors influencing the Airbnb market in Seattle.

Through the analysis, we explore different aspects of the Airbnb ecosystem, including property availability, pricing dynamics, host performance, and guest preferences. The project utilizes SQLite as the database management system to query the data and extract relevant information. The analysis involves generating meaningful visualizations, conducting statistical calculations, and interpreting the results to draw actionable insights.

Key questions addressed in this project include:

How does the availability of properties vary based on factors such as security deposits, license requirements, and number of reviews?

What is the relationship between property pricing and availability? Are cheaper properties more likely to have higher availability?

Which neighborhoods in Seattle have the highest-rated properties based on guest reviews?

Is there any correlation between room price and review scores, indicating guest satisfaction levels?

By exploring these questions, this project aims to provide valuable insights into the Seattle Airbnb market and contribute to a better understanding of the dynamics between hosts, guests, and the platform itself. The findings can be utilized by hosts to optimize their listings, by travelers to make informed booking decisions, and by Airbnb as a platform to enhance its services and offerings.

The project includes SQL queries, Python data analysis code, and Tableau visualizations, along with detailed interpretations and insights. It serves as a comprehensive exploration of the Airbnb Seattle dataset, showcasing the power of data analysis in understanding the dynamics of the short-term rental market.
